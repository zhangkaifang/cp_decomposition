# cp_decomposition
This project implements matrix missing element completion and tensor missing element completion.
- matrix_cp_one.py This file uses the gradient descent method to complete the missing elements of the matrix.
- matrix_cp_two.py This file implements matrix missing element completion by using alternating least squares.
